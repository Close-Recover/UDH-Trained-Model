# UDH-Trained-Model
**It can be frustrating to find that you have no access to a trained model. What make it worse are that the authors do not reply emails and their codes do not run properly. Therefore, I create this repository.**

This repository contains the trained model(s) and details in training. The model is derived from the [original UDH repository](https://github.com/ChaoningZhang/Universal-Deep-Hiding) and I trained it on my own machine. Feel free to do anything as long as follow the license. Maybe in the future I will train and upload more of them.

Because of many limitations and barriers, I use `split.py` and `add_txt.py` to transfer model files. Use `rm_txt.py` and `merge.py` sequentially to recover them, you will then get a `trained_model.tar.gz` file.
